# Cafe-Database-Management-System
The Cafe Management System is a web application developed to manage and streamline the day-to-day operations of a cafe. This system includes functionalities for adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving records of food items, orders, and customer information. 
Built using HTML, CSS, PHP, and a centralized database, the project aims to simplify tasks for cafe managers, customers, and other staff by offering an interactive interface for handling orders, billing, and menu management.

Database Structure
The database for the Cafe Management System is designed to support efficient handling of cafe operations, including managing menu items, orders, and customer information. Key tables include MANAGER for storing manager details, CUSTOMERS for customer records, ORDERS to track each order placed, BILL for bill generation, and MENU for available food items. Additionally, tables like CART manage customer selections, while CATEGORY organizes menu items by type. Relationships between tables allow for functionalities such as adding items to orders, generating bills, and categorizing food items. The design ensures streamlined access and manipulation of records, facilitating smooth operations for cafe staff and a convenient experience for customers.
